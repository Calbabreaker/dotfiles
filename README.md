# Dotfiles

Personal dot files (aka configuration files) for neovim, git, zsh and alacritty.

## Setup

All you have to do is clone this repository, run the setup.sh to get dotfiles to work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Calbabreaker/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

Note that this script overides the dotfiles already on the system.

You should also install xclip, ripgrep, and a nerd font for neovim.
